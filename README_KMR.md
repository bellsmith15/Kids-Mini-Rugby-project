# Kids Mini Rugby

Kids Mini Rugby is a site targeted for parents to find out about Mini Tag Rugby for juniors at their local rugby club in Guildford.  The site hopes to help users navigate what is on offer for children from the ages of 5 to 10 years old.  It will give information to parents seeking to sign up their child / children for mini tag rugby at the weekends at their local community rugby club. It will provide descriptions of the Club Officials who are volunteers and list the times and days available for the coaching sessions that are run.

It hopes to provide a friendly representation of the club by including images and videos of play and a map with directions for where the games are played.

## Features 

The website will have four navigation headings;

1. Home page
2. About Us
3. Gallery page
4. Sign Up page

I have chosen the color schemes of red, green and an off-white for the background.  These colors compliment the images that have been used on the website. I produced wireframes on Balsamiq as an example of the pages I was considering doing. (see links below)  After my call with my mentor, they suggested that I put the "About Us" information into the home page and not on another page and instead create a link within the home page to the nav bar, which will create three pages to the site.

![Gallery page](/assets/readme-files/wireframes/gallery-v1.png)
![Sign Up page](/assets/readme-files/wireframes/sign-up-v1.png)

After consideration and discussion with my mentor I chose to create Homepage-v2 a Gallery and Sign Up pages.  I also added a link half way down the Home page to the Sign Up page to make it easier for users to find the form to complete to join the rugby sessions.  I want my users to find a site that is easy for them to navigate around to find out information about the friendly club.  They will be able to find a brief description of each age groups activity, the times and location and a sign up form. To make the user feel inclusive about joining there are images and videos for them to familiarize themselves.

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar will be featured on all three pages. The navigation will link to the Home page, the About Us section within the home page, the Gallery and the Sign Up page.  This will allow the users to easily navigate between each of the pages. There will be a hover activation when the user browses over the menus and a red bottom margin line indicating what current page they are on.

  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __The Landing Page Image__

  - On the landing page the user will see a main image of two boys in a rugby tackle with a welcome message and information about what is available and images and or videos of sessions.

- __What the club offers__

  - The club offers section will allow the user to see what is offered and the different training sessions by age group that are provided. They will see an about us section where they will be able to either view images or video under the catergories of who, what and coaching.

  - There will be navigation links to the about us and sign up in this section.

  - The footer section includes contact information and links to social media sites for kids mini rugby. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. There will be a Directions anchor that will take the user to the sign up page where a googlemap displays the club address.

- The Gallery will display images of children and coaches so that the user can see what the rugby sessions are like and if they would be interested in signing up for sessions.

![Gallery](/assets/readme-files/screenshots/gallery.png)

- __The Sign Up Page__

- The sign up page will allow the users to sign their children up for a session in either the U6, U7, U8, U9 or U10 category. On landing on this page the user will need to submit their own name, their child / childrens name and an email address and any additional information they might find inmportant to advise the club.

- The page will also contain a map of where the club is in Guildford and also a brief summary about what each age group does in their rugby session.

![Sign Up](/assets/readme-files/screenshots/sign-up-page.png)

- __Additional Features__

- In the future updates to the form to include e-commerce section for making a payment for sessions either weekly monthly or for the season. It would describe the discounts you could save if the payment was in full compared to weekly. It would allow the user to sign up to the session and also pay in advance of going.  Giving a financial benefit to the club.

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

### Unfixed Bugs

<!-- You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.  -->

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - Login to GitHub with my Username and password

<!-- ## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
